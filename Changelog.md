## v0.2.0 (2023-03-14)

### Breaking

* [Redesign: Create a `dora-daemon` as a communication broker](https://github.com/dora-rs/dora/pull/162)
  * New `dora-daemon` executable that acts as a communication hub for all local nodes
  * Large messages are passed through shared memory without any copying
  * [Replaces the previous `iceoryx` communication layer](https://github.com/dora-rs/dora/pull/201)
  * Small API change: Nodes and operators now receive _events_ instead of just inputs
    * Inputs are one type of event
    * Other supported events: `InputClosed` when an input stream is closed and `Stop` when the user stops the dataflow (e.g. through the CLI)

### Features

* Better Error handling when operator fails
* [Send small messages directly without shared memory](https://github.com/dora-rs/dora/pull/193)
* [Send all queued incoming events at once on `NextEvent` request](https://github.com/dora-rs/dora/pull/194)
* [Don't send replies for `SendMessage` requests when using TCP](https://github.com/dora-rs/dora/pull/195)
* [Allocate shared memory in nodes to improve throughput](https://github.com/dora-rs/dora/pull/200)

### Fixes

* [Manage node failure: Await all nodes to finish before marking dataflow as finished](https://github.com/dora-rs/dora/pull/183)

### Other

* [Use `DoraStatus` from dora library in template](https://github.com/dora-rs/dora/pull/182)
* [Simplify: Replace `library_filename` function with `format!` call](https://github.com/dora-rs/dora/pull/191)
* [Refactor Rust node API implementation](https://github.com/dora-rs/dora/pull/196)
* [Remove code duplicate for tracing subscriber and use env variable to manage log level.](https://github.com/dora-rs/dora/pull/197)

## v0.1.2 (2022-12-15)

- Fix infinite loop in the coordinator: https://github.com/dora-rs/dora/pull/155
- Simplify the release process: https://github.com/dora-rs/dora/pull/157
- Use generic linux distribution: https://github.com/dora-rs/dora/pull/159

## v0.1.1 (2022-12-05)

This release contains fixes for:
- Python linking using pypi release but also a redesigned python thread model within the runtime to avoid deadlock of the `GIL`. This also fix an issue with `patchelf`.
- A deployment separation for `ubuntu` as the `20.04` version of `dora` and `22.04` version of dora are non-compatible.
- A better tagging of api for `dora` Rust API.

## v0.1.0 (2022-11-15)

This is our first release of `dora-rs`!

The current release includes:
- `dora-cli` which enables creating, starting and stopping dataflow.
- `dora-coordinator` which is our control plane.
- `dora-runtime` which is manage the runtime of operators.
- `custom-nodes` API which enables bridges from different languages.
